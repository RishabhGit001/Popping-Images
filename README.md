# Popping-Images

# JavaScript Mini Project 🚨

This website is the entry level Clone of one of the award listing websites.🌐

✅What does this website do?
As you Hover over the text some bunch of images will pop with a gap of certain time.

I have created this website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

📝The main features of the website: 

📌 Used Throttling which will call the function after a particular interval of time.

📌 Used Gsap, which will help in smooth transitions while hovering.

📌 Popping multiple images , created an array of images.
